# ðŸ¤– Current Research Project
**Motivation.** In current Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) tasks, RL has not fully showcased its strengths for LLMs.

**Ongoing.** (1) Conducting controlled experiments to reveal the limitations of todayâ€™s RL fine-tuning setups for LLMs; (2) analyzing the observed failure modes to introduce a new RL paradigm for LLMs.
