I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University (2020 – present), supervised by Prof. <a href="https://aperrault.github.io/">Andrew Perrault</a> and Prof. <a href="https://zhihuizhu.github.io/">Zhihui Zhu</a>. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Xidian University in 2020.

My research interests include deep reinforcement learning (RL), machine learning interpretability, and large language models (LLMs). I am actively seeking academic collaborations and industry roles; if you would like to collaborate or consider me for a position, please email me at [chen.10183@buckeyemail.osu.edu](mailto:chen.10183@buckeyemail.osu.edu).
